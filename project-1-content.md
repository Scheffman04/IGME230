## Overview
Hyper-Drive is a game in which the player travels through the hyper drive rails on a mission to collect space gems while dodging oncoming debris. 
Your reflexes will be tested as you must make split second inputs to dodge the debris, or hope you're lucky enough to have your blaster charged to blast right through!

===================================================

## I. Concept
 The player must expertly jump between hyperdrive tubes as a space racer, and be able to quickly dodge space debris while collecting space gems. Catch energy cells to blast through anything in your way!

## II. Genre
This is a rail-gunner type game where the player will be forced into one of three lanes and needs fast reflexes to switch lanes and avoid obstacles. 

## III. Platform
This game will function only on desktop to give players the more comfortable control scheme

## IV. Story
There is no overarching narrative, but players should strive to beat their highest scores and feel the thrill of traveling through space as a high flying cruiser.

## V. Aesthetic
The game will be in 8 bit style, and go for the more retro arcade feel. Main music will involve an 8 bit theme as well as quick blips and bloops for gaining points, and a satisfying explosion for the death noise.
            
## VI. Gameplay
The player will be stuck to the 3 lanes of the hyperdrives, and strive to collect space gems for points while dodging debris. 
For every 100 points the players ship will speed up slightly, adding a ramping difficulty as the player gets a higher score.
Every once in a while the player can pick up a power module that will give them a single blast to break any debris they cant dodge in time, but they only get one shot per module. The player will only be able to move side to side by using the A and D keys, and when they have it they will use spacebar to fire their energy blast. Their will be instructions on the side of the screen at all times, along with a chart denoting the point values of items and what power ups do. To become proficient at the game the player will need to be able to judge when to use their one shot, and when to try and dodge the debris. The player will also need to be able to notice the increasing speed of the game and adjust their timing for dodges accordingly.
